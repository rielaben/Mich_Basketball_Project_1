# Mich_Basketball_Project_1
First project completed for the Michigan Basketball Team

Myself and partner Charlie Logan analyzed trends from the large amounts of movement data the team has collected from the Catapult wearable technology devices players use during games and practices. With this data and using data from Basketball Reference, we conducted an exploratory analysis on how certain playing styles from opposing teams within the Big Ten were affecting player workload for Michigan players.

Since the actual Game Log information is private, that cannot be uploaded, but the code to analyze the data is included in this project.
